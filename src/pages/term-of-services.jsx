              <strong>Disclosure of Confidential Information:</strong> You or us
              (the “Disclosing Party”) may from time to time, while Your
              Subscriptions are valid, disclose to the other (the “Receiving
              Party”) the Disclosing Party’s confidential, proprietary and/or
              non-public information, materials or knowledge that is designated
              as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be
              confidential given the nature of the information, materials or
              knowledge and/or the circumstances of disclosure (the
              “Confidential Information”). For purposes of these User Terms,
              Your Confidential Information includes your Trade Book and service
              data, and our Confidential Information includes the Services. The
              Receiving Party agrees to protect the Disclosing Party’s
              Confidential Information from unauthorized access, disclosure or
              use in the same manner that the Receiving Party protects its own
              confidential or proprietary information of a similar nature but
              with no less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party will only
              access and use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in
              connection with performing these User Terms (or as expressly
              authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing), and will disclose
              the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information only to the
              employees and contractors of the Receiving Party who have a need
              to know the Confidential Information for purposes of performing
              these User Terms (or for other purposes as expressly authorized by
              the Disclosing Party in writing) and who are under a duty of
              confidentiality no less restrictive than the Receiving Party’s
              duty hereunder.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Termination of Confidentiality obligations:</strong> The
              Receiving Party’s obligations with respect to Confidential
              Information of the Disclosing Party will terminate if the
              Receiving Party can document that such information (i) was already
              lawfully known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure by
              the Disclosing Party free from any obligation of confidence, (ii)
              was disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party who had the
              right to make such disclosure without any confidentiality
              restrictions, (iii) is, or through no fault of the Receiving Party
              has become, generally available to the public, or (iv) was
              independently developed by the Receiving Party without access to,
              or use of, the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. In
              addition, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential
              Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent also this...
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Receiving Party may be compelled by law or a court or other
            judicial or administrative body to disclose Confidential
            Information. In such cases, the Receiving Party must notify the
            Disclosing Party promptly and in writing (to the extent legally
            permitted) and cooperate with the Disclosing Party, at the
            Disclosing Party’s reasonable request and expense, in any lawful
            action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure.
            Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving
            Party will return all Confidential Information in their possession
            or control and permanently erase all electronic copies. The
            Receiving Party will also certify in writing that it has fully
            complied with its obligations under this section. However, the User
            may download or make copies of the Reports generated by the Platform
            for personal use and is under no obligation to return these after

            We will make reasonable efforts to keep the Services operational but
            are not liable for any failure caused by circumstances beyond our

            unauthorized use, or misuse of the Services. Additionally, we are
            not responsible for any problems arising from third-party services
            or planned downtime.
