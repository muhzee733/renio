In Morocco and the UAE, governments have banned or regulated the use of single-use plastic bags, encouraging businesses and citizens to switch to sustainable alternatives. Alongside government initiatives, the private sector is also stepping in. Dubai-based DGrade, a company specializing in plastic recycling, transforms plastic bottles into clothing and other products. Their “Simply Bottles” program focuses on collecting plastic waste from schools, offices, and communities in the UAE, converting it into polyester yarn for the production of eco-friendly textiles. These efforts are helping to curb plastic waste while promoting sustainable business practices and consumer awareness."
